# Changelog

## [5.1.2](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-bootstrap-components/compare/5.1.1...5.1.2)

2021-09-01

* Fixed a radio component value wrong behavior which implied that it could be changed from an old or model value.

## [5.1.1](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-bootstrap-components/compare/5.1.0...5.1.1)

2021-02-20

* Added the ability to disable the select component placeholder option with the new `->disablePlaceholder()` method
* Deprecations :
  * The select component `->disabled()` method usages should be replaced by `->disableOptions()`
  * The select component `->selected()` method usages should be replaced by `->selectOptions()`
  * These deprecated methods will be removed in the next major version
  * These renaming are improving understanding about what these methods are actually doing

## [5.0.2](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-bootstrap-components/compare/5.0.1...5.0.2)

* The `Field correctly filled.` validation feedback sentence has been removed. The `is-valid` class is enough to highlight valid fields and this will avoid forms overloading
* The `bootstrap-components.form.formValidation.displaySuccess` config value is now set to `true` by default, in order to highlight valid fields when some of them are in error
* In relation with the 2 points above, you're advised to pass the `bootstrap-components.form.formValidation.displaySuccess` config value to `true` if you published the package configuration file, in order to improve the ergonomics of your forms
